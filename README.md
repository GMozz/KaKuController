# KaKuController
A simple controller for an Arduino (Nano) that can receive and transmit KaKu (KlikAanKlikUit) signals through cheap 433MHz receivers and transmitters.

When receiving a valid signal this will be printed on the Serial Monitor. Through the Serial Monitor these signals can also be transmitted.
